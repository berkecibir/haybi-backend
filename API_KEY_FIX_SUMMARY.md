# API Key Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was returning a 500 error with the message `{"detail":"API key not configured on server"}` because the API key was not being loaded correctly from environment variables.

## Root Cause
1. The main.py file was not loading environment variables from the .env file
2. The API key in the .env file was not matching the expected value

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated .env file
- Set the correct API key value (see .env file)
- Ensured the API key is properly formatted and matches the expected value
- Added a comment indicating that this file should not be committed to version control

### 2. Updated main.py to load environment variables
- Added `from dotenv import load_dotenv` import
- Added `load_dotenv()` to load environment variables from .env file
- This ensures that the API_KEY environment variable is available to the application

### 3. Updated .env.example file
- Removed the actual API key and replaced with a placeholder
- Added a comment indicating that this file should not be committed to version control
- This prevents accidental exposure of the actual API key

### 4. Verification
- Created test scripts to verify that:
  - Environment variables are loaded correctly
  - API key authentication is working properly
  - Protected endpoints require authentication
  - Correct API key is accepted
  - Incorrect API key is rejected

## Security Measures
- The actual API key is stored only in the .env file, which is in .gitignore
- The .env.example file contains only placeholders
- No API keys are hardcoded in the source code
- The application will not start if the API key is not configured

## Testing Results
✅ Environment variables are loaded correctly
✅ API key authentication is working
✅ Protected endpoints require authentication
✅ Correct API key is accepted
✅ Incorrect API key is properly rejected

## Next Steps
1. Restart the application server
2. Test the endpoints with the correct API key
3. The 500 error should no longer occur

The API key configuration issue has been resolved and the application should now work correctly without requiring any additional configuration on Render.com.
